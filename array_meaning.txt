Array

Array stores multiple values in one single variable:

Array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

If you have a list of items(a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

$cars1 ="Volvo";
$cars2 = "BMW";
$car3 = "Toyota";


Create an Array in PHP
in PHP, the array() function is used to create an array:

in PHP, there are three types of arrays:
- Indexed array - Arrays with a numeric index
- Associative arrays -Arrays with named keys
- Multidimensional arrays -Array containing one or more arrays


PHP Indexed Arays
there ar two ways to create indexed arrays:
- $cars = array("Volvo","BMW", "Toyota");

or the index can be assigned manually:
	$cars1 ="Volvo";
	$cars2 = "BMW";
	$car3 = "Toyota";

PHP Associative Arrays
Assciative arrays are arrays that use named keys that you assign to them.

There are two ways to create an associative array:

- $age = array("Peter"=>"35", "Ben"=> "33", "Joe"=>"45");

Or
- $age['Peter']= "35";
- $age['Ben'] = "33";
- $age['Joe'] = "45";
